My Sublime Text 2 Settings and Keymaps

- Use a 3-pane layout in place of "4 column" layout [Command+Option+4]
- Reveal-in-side-bar with Textmate-like key combo [Command+Shift+R]
- Insert current date [Ctrl+D] or datetime [Ctrl+D Ctrl+D]
- Toggle Line Numbers in the gutter [Command+K Command+N]
- After selecting text, allow ESC to deselect and return cursor to previous position

Theme

- I use a modified version of Monokai: the highlighting color is blue and brighter, even when Sublime Text is not in focus (much easier to visually inspect and compare text)
